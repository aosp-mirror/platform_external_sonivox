# Fork of the AOSP 'platform_external_sonivox' project to use it outside of Android 

[![Linux Build and Test](https://github.com/pedrolcl/sonivox/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pedrolcl/sonivox/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

This project is a fork of the Android Open Source Project 'platform_external_sonivox', including a CMake based build system to be used not on Android, but on any other computer Operating System.
Google licensed this work originally named Sonivox EAS (Embedded Audio Synthesis) from the company Sonic Network Inc. under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.

This is a Wave Table synthesizer, not using external soundfont files but embedded samples instead. It is also a real time GM synthesizer. It consumes very little resources, so it may be indicated in projects for small embedded devices.
There is neither MIDI input nor Audio output facilities included in the library. You need to provide your own input/output.

You may find several projects already using this library as a git submodule:

* [Linux-SonivoxEas](https://github.com/pedrolcl/Linux-SonivoxEas) with ALSA Sequencer MIDI input and Pulseaudio output.
* [multiplatform-sonivoxeas](https://github.com/pedrolcl/multiplatform-sonivoxeas) with Drumstick::RT MIDI input and Qt Multimedia audio output.

The build system has two options: `BUILD_SONIVOX_STATIC` and `BUILD_SONIVOX_SHARED` to control the generation and install of both the static and shared libraries from the sources. Both options are ON by default.
Another option is `BUILD_TESTING`, also ON by default, to control if the unit tests are built, which require Google Test.
See also the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html) for common build options.

This fork currently reverts these commits:

* Full revert of [af41595](https://github.com/pedrolcl/platform_external_sonivox/commit/af41595537b044618234fe7dd9ebfcc652de1576) (Remove unused code from midi engine)
* Full revert of [34ba480](https://github.com/pedrolcl/platform_external_sonivox/commit/34ba4804f643549b8ac74e5f56bfe64db3234447) (Remove unused code)
* Partial revert of [2fa59c8](https://github.com/pedrolcl/platform_external_sonivox/commit/2fa59c8c6851b453271f33f254c7549fa79d07fb) (Build separate sonivox libs with and without jet...)

All the sources from the Android repository are kept in place, but some are not built and included in the compiled products. A few headers, mostly empty, are included in the 'fakes' subdirectory to allow compilation outside Android.

## Using the library

You may find and use the installed libraries with `pkg-config` or the `find_package()` CMake command. The library API is documented in the 'docs' directory contents.

The 'example' directory contains a simple command line utility to render standard MIDI files into raw PCM audio streams. This utility can be compiled after building and installing sonivox in some prefix like `/usr`, `/usr/local`, or `$HOME/Sonivox`.
The CMake script contains three alternatives: using CMake only, using `pkg-config` and using sonivox as a subdirectory.

Once compiled, you can use the program to listen MIDI files or to create MP3 files.

Example 1: Render a MIDI file and save the rendered audio as a raw audio file:

    $ sonivoxrender ants.mid > ants.pcm

Example 2: pipe the rendered audio thru the Linux ALSA 'aplay' utility:

    $ sonivoxrender ants.mid | aplay -c 2 -f S16_LE -r 22050

Example 3: pipe the rendered audio thru the 'lame' utility creating a MP3 file:

    $ sonivoxrender ants.mid | lame -r -s 22050 - ants.mp3

You may replace "ants.mid" by another MIDI or XMF file, like "test/res/testmxmf.mxmf"

## Unit tests

The Android unit tests have been integrated in the CMake build system, with little modifications. A requirement is GoogleTest, either installed system wide or it will be downloaded from the git repository. 

It is **strongly** recommended that you run the test suite after changing some code or before trying the library on a new platform/compiler. Some compiler versions are known to output crashing products. Running the unit tests is a practical way to quickly detect this problem.

To run the tests, you may use this command:

	$ cmake --build <build_directory> --target test
        
or simply:

	$ ctest

There are two environment variables that you may set before running the tests (mandatory for the Qt Creator integrated test runner).

	TEMP		< path to a temporary location with write permission for the output file >
	TEST_RESOURCES	< path to the location of the input MIDI files: source_directory/test/res/ for instance >
